* Goal
Understand how authentication cookie is generated then try to spoof the authentication cookie and login as =Tom=
*** Known credentials
| username | password |
|----------+----------|
| webgoat  | webgoat  |
| admin    | admin    |
* Solution
Login with these credentials and observe those cookies
1. Decode cookie with base64 decoder [result something like] -> =574f524a4f75707053536e696d6461=
2. Decode this hex value to text [result something like] -> =WORJOuppSSnimda=
3. Now reverse this text [result something like] -> =adminSSppuOJROW=
4. Now replace =admin= with =Tom= and do above steps reversely to get =spoof_auth= cookie for =Tom=
